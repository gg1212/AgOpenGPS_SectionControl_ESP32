# Mueller Spray Control computer ESP32 Section Control
## Overview
I have connected my section control unit between the existing Mueller Spray Control boxes and the sprayer. This allows me to do section control without any modification to the existing boxes and cables.

In manual mode, AOG displays the working area based on the section status.

In automatic mode, AOG controls the relays and the sprayer does GPS automatic section control based on AOG data.
